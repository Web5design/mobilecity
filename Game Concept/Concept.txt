Game Concept #1 Student @ UCL

Objectives:

Diverting agents towards locations

The number of agents reaching the locations will generate a scoring system based on where they end up i.e.


Pubs - Happiness (affects the speed agents move at)
Libraries & lecture buildings - Intelligence (affects their training level to score)


Places of Work:

Hospital & research buildings - high skill
Offices - mid skill
Restaurants - low skill


Based on top of the UCL campus area, the agents will spawn out of set point(s) main campus building or transport links


To affect the agents, the player will be able to place boosts, diversions and waypoints to move the agents around:

bus stops
road blocks
junk food
